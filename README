ABOUT LDD3-EXAMPLES

This project provides updated examples of the book ``Linux Device Drivers 3rd".
Original examples of the book were written for kernel 2.6.10, and they are out
of date a little because of frequent kernel changes.  When the project was
created, latest kernel version is 2.6.37.  These examples work normally and
have been tested under kernel 2.6.32 (Debian) and 2.6.35 (Ubuntu).

WARNING: Examples have been tested are

	* misc-modules
	* scull
